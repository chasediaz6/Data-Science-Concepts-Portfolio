# Machine Learning Concepts + Algorithms Portfolio 

A collection of ML projects completed through my Masters coursework. Many projects involved writing ML algorithms from scratch.

| Image Compression Using K-Means  | In a colored image, each pixel is of size 3 bytes (RGB), where each color can have intensity values from 0 to 255. As humans, we can only practically visualize a few colors in an image. So the k-Means Clustering algorithm takes advantage of the visual perception of the human eye and uses a few colors to represent the image. Colors having different values of intensity that are RGB values seem the same to the human eye. The K-Means algorithm takes this advantage and clubs similar looking colors (which are close together in a cluster). This project builds the k-means algorithm from scratch, and uses it to compress the many colors in an image into the most prominent colors. |
| ISOMAP: Non-linear Dimensionality Reduction  | ISOMAP is a non-linear dimension reduction method to reduce the size and complexity of a dataset, projecting it onto a new plane. This method is useful for datasets with non-linear structure, where PCA and MDS will not be appropriate | 
| Facial Recognition using PCA - Eigenfaces  | Using facial images from The Yale Face Database B, where there are 64 images under different lighting conditions per each of 10 distinct subjects, 640 face images in total. |
