# **PCA: European Food Consumption**

## **PCA Analysis of European Food Consumption**:
Implementing Principal Component Analysis from scratch on a dataset consisting of 16 European countries and their consumption for 20 food items, such as tea, jam, and coffee. By visualizing this data using the 2 principal components, we can see which countries have similar diets and which foods are more strongly correlated in terms of consumption across these countries. This analysis enables us to uncover underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset, shedding light on dietary preferences and potential regional similarities.

## **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique used in statistics and machine learning to simplify complex datasets with many features by transforming them into a new coordinate system. It identifies the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features that capture the maximum variance in the data. By projecting data onto these principal components, PCA helps to highlight the most significant patterns and relationships, making it easier to analyze and visualize data in two dimensions.

### PCA Applications:
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is widely used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining as much of the original variability as possible. This simplifies models, speeds up computations, and helps avoid overfitting.
- **Data Visualization**: PCA is valuable for visualizing high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions. It aids in identifying trends, clusters, or outliers in the data, making it easier to interpret and understand complex datasets.
