## Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique used in statistics and machine learning to simplify complex datasets with many features by transforming them into a new coordinate system. It identifies the principal components, which are linear combinations of the original features that capture the maximum variance in the data. By projecting data onto these principal components, PCA helps to highlight the most significant patterns and relationships, making it easier to analyze and visualize data in two dimensions.
